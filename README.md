# depcharter

creates project dependency diagrams from visual studio solution files in Graphviz DOT format
this project was inspired by:

http://www.codeproject.com/KB/trace/dependencygraph.aspx
and
http://jamiepenney.co.nz/2009/02/10/viewing-dependencies-between-projects-in-visual-studio/

but both projects depend on internal visual studio API's to read the .sln files. (and so they rely on professional versions of visual studio to build).
This project performs simular functions (and hopefully more) and also works with the express editions.
