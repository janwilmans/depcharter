Note: these steps should be executed manually:

- press 'install' to extract to c:\program files\depcharter (path hardcoded in .reg files to add context menus)

- run "Add DepCharter to Context Menu.reg" and confirm the additions should be added to the registry

- install Graphviz (tested with graphviz-2.24.msi)

- now you can right-click any .sln file to generate graphs
